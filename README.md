# Image-converters
A suite of programs for image manipulation.

image_thumb.py will take all image files in the current folder and make thumbnails for each image.

images.py will perform an action on a single image file. You can change the filter and add more filters as needed. Look up the docs for PIL if you need more info.

JPGtoPNG.py will take an image folder and destination folder from the command line and convert all jpeg images in the image folder and place them as a png in the destination folder.
